# Overview

First you navigate to the game webpage. When you arrive on the screen you then either enter a room code or click the host button. If you hit the Host button a 4 digit number will appear give this code to the other player who wishes to join your game. After this is done a game should start when it does each player with choose cards to move to the bluff zone. Once each player has submit bluff cards they will then select a card to play against the other players card. Each card 1-5 determines how it wins such as 5 beats each number under it except 1. After the player who won will draw cards 2x the number of cards they bet. Then the steps repeat until one player runs out of cards in their hand. The player who still has cards in their hand wins.

# Development Environment

_Code:_ To develop the code we used Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It has gained widespread popularity among developers for its lightweight, fast, and customizable nature. VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages and offers a rich set of features to enhance the coding experience.
We also used Live Server that is not a built-in feature of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), but it is a popular extension that developers can install to enhance their web development workflow. Live Server simplifies the process of previewing and testing web pages by providing a local development server.
And finally, we also used Visual Studio Live Share that is another extension for Visual Studio Code, and it's designed to facilitate collaborative development among team members or between developers and other stakeholders. With Live Share, multiple developers can collaboratively edit and debug code in real-time, regardless of their physical location.

_Database:_ Firebase is a platform developed by Google that provides a variety of services for building and scaling web and mobile applications. It offers a suite of tools and services to help developers with tasks such as authentication, real-time database management, hosting, cloud functions, and more. One of the key services within Firebase is Firestore, which is a NoSQL cloud database.


_Programing Language:_ JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
